                    <p>Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to solve, but so so so many Uls get it wrong. I see this frequently enough that, rather than complain about them individually, I though I'd just write down the set of rules they often break.</p>

                    <p>There may be cases where some of these rules aren't the best thing to do, but there should be a good reason for breaking one of these rules (for example, some of these rules don't apply if a field must be filled with a value from a fixed set, like the list of US states). Following these roles should always result in at very least a sane experience:</p>
